                    Arachnotrons are built with genetic material recovered from the
                    remains of the original Spider Mastermind, bio-engineered
                    for cyber-augmentation. While its actual body exhibits only limited
                    mobility, the oddly cerebral qualities of the Arachnotron make it a
                    prime candidate for the impulse-controlled prosthetic frame that it
                    now permanently inhabits. The UAC facility responsible for the
                    Arachnotron's creation, intended to engineer and weaponize demons
                    of its own design, was overrun after an outbreak occurred at its
                    assembly plant, killing everyone inside. The facility, still
                    operating under the directive of the administrative AI, continues
                    to manufacture Arachnotrons autonomously.

                    tempered by the crashing waves of the magmatic tide,
                    these sulfuric planes of Hell have long served as banishing

                    sentenced as their final destination. The Fireborne Barons
                    have evolved in this environment, sustaining themselves
                    on the remnants of the damned, growing obsidian carapaces
                    and in time becoming infused with the very incendiary matter

                    bottomless and murky depths of Hell in search of easy prey.
                    An aimless wanderer, the Cacodemon is mostly devoid of
                    cognitive ability, sensory awareness, and otherwise commonly

                    A variation of the Hell Knight breed, the Dread Knight

                    for the right to fight in the front lines of their army,
                    has since become a place of blood-sport. In violation of

                    An abhorrent creation of the Umbral Plains,
                    the Pain Elemental is descended from the primal,
                    abominable depths of the demon world. Knowing only
                    its own torment, the Elemental is cursed to forge
                    Lost Souls within the fiery pit of its gut--a
                    process that is excruciating and without end for
                    the duration of the creature's miserable lifespan.
                    The Elemental's only reprieve from its own agonizing
                    and torturous existence is the projection of suffering
                    into the world. For this reason, the Pain Elemental
                    reaps great satisfaction from indiscriminate killing
                    and the infliction of misery upon those weaker than itself.

                    As Hell emerged on Earth the Pinky began to
                    appear on terrestrial soil in great number,
                    rapidly becoming the bane of existence to ARC
                    military fortifications. Utilizing its armored
                    frontal carapace, the Pinky is able to penetrate
                    defensive encampments, breaking through walled
                    defenses and using its ramming ability to upturn
                    and immobilize armored vehicles. ARC deployments,
                    dependent on their ability to hold the line against
                    encroaching forces of Hell, could be disrupted and
                    even overtaken by a single Pinky, were it able to
                    penetrate and break through their defensive matrix.
                    allowing a greater demon influx to pour in after it.
                    The ARC rapidly prioritized the target status of the
                    Pinky, issuing high-range bombardment to prevent the
                    Pinky from gaining proximity.

                    The Revenant program, a bio-weapon experiment
                    utilizing re-animated necrotic human tissue, was
                    believed to have been destroyed with the collapse
                    of the UAC facility on Mars. However, the emergence
                    of the Cultist enclaves on Earth - former UAC
                    deviations now under Hell's direct control - have
                    begun work on a second wave of production of the
                    Revenant program. While much of the platform's existing
                    weapon payload is preserved as originally designed, the
                    cyber-neural programming has undergone modification.
                    Patterned signals are wired to the host's frontal cortex,
                    which in turn stimulate a state of frenzied, unrestrained
                    bloodlust. While these signals are active, the host is
                    incapable of thinking or feeling anything but a singular
                    compulsion to inflict death and violence on the living.

                    Demon Lords to the black soul pits of Babel,
                    the Tyrants have long served as wardens and

                    are tasked with overseeing the collection and

                    their role in Hell ordained by the unholy sigil of
                    the Elder Hell-gods. A sadistic master of lesser demons,
                    the Tyrants are feared for their cruelty and malice.

                    The Khan Maykr is one of the many Khan Maykrs
                    that is birthed by the Singularity, the collective
                    Maykr consciousness, that is destiny-bound to lead
                    the Maykr race until the next Khan is born.
                    The Singularity, which contains the conscious
                    soul-data of every major Maykr that has ever lived
                    and died, processes and refines this data as a means
                    of selective evolution. As hierarch of the conscious
                    neural-matrix to which each Maykr is interconnected
                    like a hivemind, it is physically impossible for a
                    Maykr to refuse the collective order of shared
                    consciousness and disobey a Khan. This system has
                    functioned without error since the creation of Urdak,
                    until the disappearance of The Father, the progenitor
                    of the Maykr race, caused by a rogue Maykr known as the
                    Seraphim. Without the Father, the Maykrs are incapable
                    of creating a successor to the Khan lineage, allowing
                    the current Khan Maykr to rule Urdak without limit.
